    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge is intended to provide the school board and mayor an analysis to support them in making strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.  Data used for the analysis included information from 15 different schools and standardized test data from nearly 40K students.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- The top five highest-performing schools in the assessment, based on the overall passing percentage of both reading and math tests, were all Charter Schools.  The five lowest-performing schools, based on the same data, were District Schools\n",
    "\n",
    "--- Higher average math and reading test scores were inversely related to the amount spent by the schools per student.   Results indicate that an increase in spending by schools may not be required to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- Evaluation of the size of schools showed average math and reading scores, as well passing percentages, were similar between the small and medium size schools   These same indicators were all significantly lower in the large schools.  Only one charter school was considered large, slightly over the threshold considered in the range of 2000-5000 students.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- Based on the type of school students attended, the charter schools outperformed the district schools in all metrics.  The most significant factor in comparison is the size of the schools, which may also correlate to smaller classroom sizes and smaller student-to-teacher ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "When setting plans and priorities for PyCity Schools, the size of schools and classrooms should be addressed first.\n",
