Worked with Tutor last week discussion primarily on loops and prior assignment

Had 3 sessions with AskBCS Learning Assistants and one TA Office hours session
*****primary focus was working through concepts and trying to resolve issue getting calculation 
*****for number of students that passed both math and reading

Joined two study groups with classmates outside of class hours, but limited discussion as we were all in different areas of assignment progress

Assignment is incomplete - work still in progress to finish the rest.  Finally resolved the calculation tonight for # of students passing both math & reading
